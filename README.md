# Mac-Microsoft-Mouse-Handler
Use the forward/back buttons on Microsoft mouses on the Mac!

# Description
This is a small tool that nests in the status bar on your Mac. When Safari opened, you can easily use the forward and back buttons on your Microsoft mouse to navigate through the web pages.

At first launch, the app will ask you to grant it accessibility permissions. This is required to recognize the mouse button clicks. You can exit the app anytime by clicking on the icon in the status bar in the top right corner and selecting "Quit".

This app is available in German (Germany), English and Spanish (Spain).

You are encouraged to contribute to this app by forking and submitting a pull request!

# Important notes
As this is the first version, not everything might work very well so far.

This is also my very first Swift project, so please forgive me if my code still looks a bit messy here and there.
